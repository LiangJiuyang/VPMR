# VPMR package for SOE and SOG
Approximate non-singular kernel functions by `sum-of-exponentials` (SOE) or `sum-of-Gaussians` (SOG) by VP sum and model reduction.

This is a joint work with Ph.d candidate [Zixuan Gao](https://github.com/ZXGao97/) who is my partner in [Prof. Xu's group](http://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xuzl/). 
The original MATLAB codes are developed by me and Zixuan Gao. Zixuan Gao produces the graphical user interface (GUI) in MATLAB.
